Hi! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://mainlp.github.io/">Munich AI & NLP Research Lab (MaiNLP)</a> at LMU Munich, under the supervision of <a href="https://bplank.github.io/">Prof. Dr. Barbara Plank</a>.

My research focuses on reasoning in large language models. Through extensive evaluations of both the output behavior and the inner workings of current LLMs in reasoning scenarios, my work seeks to enhance our understanding of reasoning in LLMs.

In addition to my Ph.D., I have gained valuable industry experience, for example, by working as a research scientist intern at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/">FAIR, Meta</a>. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)</a> in Stockholm, and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>.

If you have questions or are interested in collaborating on research projects, please feel free to contact me!
